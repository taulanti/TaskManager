# TaskManager
Simple task manager to manage tasks which I started long time ago.
It has 3 sections, Tasks, in progress and finished. A user can create a task and register an employee then assign the task to specific employee and move tasks to in progress and finished. The purpose was to allow different departments create tasks so the designers will get the tasks and work on them without direct contact between personnel.
